### Summary of the project and the problem we are solving

A p2p platform to review smart contracts, where anyone can bring their contract for a comprehensive quality review with blockchain developers. We help developers and stakeholders confirm the quality and security of their smart contracts in a transparent, affordable way. 

### Brief background on the team and how you came up with the idea
 
During the audit of the smart contract market researched, we noticed that basically 4 big companies are engaged in this (Zeppelin solutions, New Alchemy, Bok consulting, Pty). But their prices are high and inaccessible to many.
In addition, there is no guarantee that after their audit no bugs will be found (this is proved by the history of the HKG token reissue). These solutions however have huge disadvantages:
 
 - You have to transfer your deposits to company accounts
 - You always pay! it doesn't matter on whether the bugs are found or not
 - The price is too high 
 
We decided that this service can be massively improved thanks to a reputation system, blockchain and smart contracts, so that:
 
 - Block chain developers would receive additional revenue for work
 - Contractor can find more customer, and for cheaper
 - The system trust is maximized
 - The centralization of power issue will be solved
